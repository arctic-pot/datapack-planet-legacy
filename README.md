# DataPack Planet
A cross-platform app to edit Minecraft data pack.

## About
A nice choice to edit Minecraft Java Edition DataPack.  
Notepad++ having ugly GUI and bad language support, 
VSCode is built for front-end development, so we need plugins to edit it.

The app is build with **electron** with **fluent design**.
Window frame is using Windows style.

### What did we do
We focused on editing Minecraft DataPack.
We are Minecraft player, we understood what do players need.
We optimized the file tree, editing and creating app.

### What we cannot do
For only text-editing, please choose Visual Studio Code.
We want to make the out-of-the-box application,
so we cannot support plugins.
